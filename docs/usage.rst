General Usage
=============
This tool was written with the express intent to be run from GeekTool_, and
thus it's output should be displayed on a desktop background.  That said,
the tool can easily be used generally to query vagrant's global status and
provide a different, unique view of what that tool provides.

Command Line Use
----------------
Assuming the tool is installed in the path you can call it with a simple
command line.

.. code:: bash

    $ vagrant-status.sh
